Title of the Assignment: 

Electricity Bill Analysis: Time Travel Through Energy Consumption.

Problem Statement:
"Developing a Time-Traveling Electricity Bill Analysis System Through Unsupervised Machine Learning"

In this project, the goal is to create an unsupervised machine learning system that can analyse historical electricity consumption data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies over time.
We hope the system will be capable of time-traveling through energy consumption data, allowing users to explore and understand how electricity usage patterns have evolved.
